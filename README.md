Meme Project

The base functions of the project are working, except we do not use an ajax call so there is a brief refresh of page.
The new comments append to the dom and save for future view but are not saved in the json file. I will continue to work 
on this functionality. At this point styling still needs to be done.

The only files that were changed were:
index.js - in routes
layout.jade - in views
index.jade - in views
app.js - in root
.gitignore -in root
style.css - in public - stylesheets
comments.json - in public - static
variableCOmments.json - in public - static
memes.json - in static
meme.jade - in views

and an images file was added in public

This took many many many google searches as well as the assistance of mentors
